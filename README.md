# Auto AI Project - Student Performance Predictor

Welcome to the Auto AI project! This project aims to predict student performance based on various input features using machine learning techniques. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is powered by an AI model integrated through IBM Watson.

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a web application that allows users to input data related to their study habits and performance. The application predicts student performance based on this input data using a linear regression model.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Collects data on hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample questions practiced.
- **Performance Prediction**: Utilizes a linear regression model to predict the performance index based on user input.
- **API Integration**: Connects to a backend API for processing predictions.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Loading Indicators**: Provides visual feedback while predictions are being processed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib (optional, for visualization in Python)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashpandav/Student_Performance_Predictor_IBM_Cloud.git
   cd Student_Performance_Predictor_IBM_Cloud

2. **Set Up Frontend**

   ```bash
    npm install
    
- install all the packege which are added into package.json file

3. **To Run The Project**
